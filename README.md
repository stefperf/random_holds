# random_holds
Numerical solution for [Riddle Classic 2021-07-23](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-hop-across-the-chessboard/) under the assumption that new climbing holds are only placed in gaps. I specifically chose this interpretation, even though it is not the only possible one and maybe not even the intended one, because it yields a neat general analytical solution for walls of any height:

f(x) = 2x - 1, derived [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKBAz_7YHERliuiMeoF3Oh33fwhf6QlqN1MYiw5KrMA/edit?usp=sharing) and verified by this code.

Developep in Python 3.9.
